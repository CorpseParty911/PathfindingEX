# PathfindingEX
 Demonstration of pathfinding using Unity.</br>
 The colored pegs represent different heights, with blue being the highest and yellow being the lowest.</br>
 This pathfinding algorithm calculates the distance between the two points,</br>
 then multiplies by 0.5 if the destination is lower than the start,</br>
 and by 1.5 if the opposite is true.</br>
 Press space to randomly generate a start and end point.</br>
